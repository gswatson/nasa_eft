\bigskip 
Understanding the physics of the universe, and searching for empirical tests of this physics, is an important topic in modern cosmology. This is well in line with NASA's goal in astrophysics is to discover how the universe works and explore how it began and evolved. 

\par This grant will be used at Texas A\&M University by PI Strigari and Co-I Dutta to study the earliest phases of the hot big bang through primordial black holes. We will specifically focus on using Fermi-LAT and Planck data to search for signatures of primordial black holes created in the earliest epochs in the universe. We will perform novel statistical analysis of these data sets, and use them for the first time to search for primordial black holes. 

\par This grant will fund a postdoc who will to develop theoretical methods and perform data analysis. The PI, postdoc, and Co-I Watson will work together on projects at Texas A\&M and Syracuse and will travel to conferences and seminars during the course of this funding to report the results of this research.
